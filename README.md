# InteractivePythonTimer

This timer was developed to:
  1. Allow the client to change and stop timers as needed during their manufacturing process.
  2. Give the Client a GUI that would allow them to change the timer times as needed.
  3. Show the employees what stage they are on by using LED's.

This Timer will have 3 main components to it:
  1. Use JSON to store times for each of the 10 Stages.
  2. Tkinter GUI, so the employees can can easily change the times for each stage.
  3. Python program to start and stop timers.This program will use the GPIO pins on the raspberry pi to use two physical buttons(START & STOP).The program will also use the GPIO pins and LED's to show the employees what stage they are on in the manufacturing process.
